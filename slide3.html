      <p>People often think that video games do not offer much to people,
         and that they just make the youth lazy and contribute to other problems.
         This may be the case to some degree; however, video games offer just as
         much if not more benefits than hindrances. People often forget, disregard,
         or do not know the benefits that video games can bring to people. Video
         games can help promote education, mental health, and development.</p>
