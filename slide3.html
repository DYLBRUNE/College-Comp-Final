      <p class="emt">"Computers sparked my interest when I discovered how the inside of a
          system works and is built. This led me to my lifelong passion and
          ultimately my future career choice options--information technology,
          computer engineering, or computer science. I now have my IT certification
          and PC Pro certification through the Lewis and Clark Career Center. I
          have taken Computer Maintenance and Networking at Lewis and Clark, and
          I am currently taking Computer Software Development to help me learn more
          regarding the software aspect of computers. With these certifications, I
          have not only repaired others computers but have also built my own
          personal gaming computer" ("Prompt").</p>
